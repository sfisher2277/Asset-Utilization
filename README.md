# Asset Utilization

The company wanted an easy way to track how much newly-purchased aircraft were being utilized. The request was for a simple report that automatically tracks how many hours each aircraft flew in the previous day, calendar month, and rolling 30-day lookback. I also included a trend graph for quick evaluation of whether utilization is increasing, remaining still, or decreasing.

The biggest challenge was the direction from the CEO that the report be shared with a broad employee group for visibility. Both Tableau and Power BI require licenses per user in order to view reports. In order to save the company money from having to lisence ever employee in the group the CEO wanted it shared with, I set up an automated process for Tableau to email the report attachment to me, where it is passed on to the employee group as PDF. The report runs itself and emails the group every morning.

The report is also available as an interactive dashboard for those users in executive levels who have Tableau licenses.
